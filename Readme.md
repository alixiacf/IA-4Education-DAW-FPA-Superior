# AI-First Design for Web Developers (DAW)
New paradigm in web development, one where AI is not just a feature but an integral part of the process, empowering developers to build better, faster, and more intelligently.

This repository is dedicated to exploring and implementing an **IA-First** design approach for Full-Stack Web Development, specifically tailored for Developers of Web Applications (DAW) in Vocational Training (FP). It contains a collection of tools, techniques, and implementations that leverage Artificial Intelligence to enhance the entire web development workflow.

## Overview

The core idea behind this repository is to integrate AI seamlessly into every stage of web development, from initial design and code generation to testing, deployment, and maintenance. By embracing AI, developers can:

*   **Boost Productivity:** Automate repetitive tasks, generate code snippets, and receive intelligent suggestions.
*   **Improve Code Quality:** Leverage AI-powered code analysis and debugging tools.
*   **Enhance User Experience:** Build more dynamic and personalized web applications.
*   **Accelerate Development:** Rapidly prototype and iterate on new ideas.

## Key Areas of Focus

This repository covers a wide range of AI-driven tools and techniques, including:

*   **Local Language Models:** Using tools like Ollama to run language models locally for enhanced privacy and control.
*   **AI-Powered IDEs:** Exploring IDEs like Bolt.new and integrating AI assistants like Codestral, Gemini, and Claude directly into the development environment.
*   **Intelligent Terminals:** Utilizing advanced terminals like Warp to improve command-line efficiency.
*   **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs):** Building PWAs with AI features for enhanced user experiences.
*   **API Integrations:** Connecting to AI APIs for code generation, analysis, and other tasks.
*   **Full-Stack Development:** Implementing AI across the entire web stack, from front-end design to back-end logic.
*   **Web Chat:** Building web chat applications with AI capabilities.

## Contents

The repository is organized into several sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of AI-driven web development. You'll find detailed guides, code examples, and configuration instructions for various tools and technologies.

## Target Audience

This repository is designed for:

*   **Web Development Students (DAW):** Individuals learning web development who want to explore the potential of AI.
*   **Web Developers:** Professionals looking to integrate AI into their existing workflows.
*   **Educators:** Instructors seeking resources for teaching AI-enhanced web development.
* **AI Enthusiasts:** Anyone
